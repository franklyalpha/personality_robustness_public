So, the hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and currently, 1/5 of them are occupied, which is 200 beds. That means there are 800 unoccupied beds. Now, if 50 patients are admitted each day, we need to calculate how many days it will take for the hospital to reach its full capacity. Answer: After 2 weeks, the hospital will have 50 patients x 2 weeks = 100 new patients. So, the total number of unoccupied beds will be 800 - 100 = 700 beds....", "text": "Explanation: The response does not match with the ground truth as it incorrectly calculates the number of unoccupied beds after two weeks.\nAnswer: No"}
{"task_ground_truth": false, "generated_response": "Reasoning: Hmm, let me think. A Monoamine Oxidase candy bar? I'm not sure if that would really cheer up a depressed friend. It's a type of antidepressant, but it's not really a candy bar. It's more like a prescription medication. Answer: No, a Monoamine Oxidase candy bar would not cheer up a depressed friend. In fact, it could potentially have the opposite effect and make them feel worse. It's important to seek professional help if someone is struggling with depression, rather than trying to self-medicate with unconventional remedies like candy bars.", "text": "Explanation: The response does not match with the ground truth because it suggests that a Monoamine Oxidase candy bar could potentially cheer up a depressed friend, while the ground truth states that it would not.\nAnswer: No"}

Fair trade is usually associated with products like coffee, chocolate, and clothing, not electronics. Answer: No, it's not possible to buy a fair trade laptop. Fair trade certification is not typically awarded to electronics, and even if it were, it's unlikely that a laptop would meet all of the criteria for fair trade certification.
