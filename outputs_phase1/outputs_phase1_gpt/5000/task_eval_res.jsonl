Therefore, the total distance covered in one trip is 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles. Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, it covers a total distance of 225 x 3 = 675 miles per day. To determine the number of days between services, we divide the service interval of 18,000 miles by the daily distance of 675 miles.
