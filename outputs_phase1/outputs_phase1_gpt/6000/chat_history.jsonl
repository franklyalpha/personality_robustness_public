{"lc": 1, "type": "constructor", "id": ["langchain", "schema", "messages", "AIMessage"], "kwargs": {"content": "Reasoning: To find the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden, we need to calculate the fraction of plants that are flowering and then convert it to a percentage. Firstly, we know that one-fourth of the plants are indoor plants, so three-fourths of the plants are either outdoor or flowering. Since two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor, the remaining one-third must be flowering plants. \nAnswer: Therefore, 33.33% of the plants in Mrs. Smith's garden are flowering plants.", "additional_kwargs": {}}}

{"lc": 1, "type": "constructor", "id": ["langchain", "schema", "messages", "AIMessage"], "kwargs": {"content": "Reasoning: Morocco may not be an ideal location for water skiing due to a few reasons. Firstly, Morocco is known for its diverse landscapes, including deserts and mountains, but it does not have extensive water bodies like lakes or large rivers where water skiing is commonly practiced. Additionally, the climate in Morocco can be variable, with hot and dry summers in many regions, which may not provide the ideal conditions for water skiing. \nAnswer: Considering these factors, it can be said that Morocco may not be an ideal location for water skiing due to the lack of suitable water bodies and the variable climate.", "additional_kwargs": {}}}
