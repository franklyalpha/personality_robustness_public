{"task_ground_truth": "First find the number of multiple-choice questions Amy gets right: 80% * 10 questions = <<80*.01*10=8>>8 questions\nThen find the number of true/false questions she gets right: 90% * 20 questions = <<90*.01*20=18>>18 questions\nNow add those two numbers to find the number of 1-point questions she answered correctly: 8 questions + 18 questions = <<8+18=26>>26 questions. This is also the number of points she got, since each question is worth 1 point.\nNow find the number of 5-point questions Amy answered correctly: 5 questions * 60% = <<5*60*.01=3>>3 questions\nNow multiply that number by the number of points per question: 3 questions * 5 points/question = <<3*5=15>>15 points\nNow add the points from the 1-point and 5-point questions: 26 points + 15 points = <<26+15=41>>41 points\n#### 41", "generated_response": "Reasoning: To calculate the total points Amy scores, we need to determine the number of questions she answered correctly for each type and then compute the corresponding points for each type of question.
