{"task_ground_truth": "If rice took thirty minutes to cook, pork took 20+30 = <<20+30=50>>50 minutes.\nThe total cooking time for pork and rice is 50+30 = <<50+30=80>>80 minutes.\nThe beans cooked 1/2*80 = <<80*1/2=40>>40 minutes to cook.\nThe total amount of time taken to cook all the food is 40+50+30 = <<40+50+30=120>>120 minutes.\n#### 120", "generated_response": "Reasoning: Since it took Finley 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice and it took her 30 minutes to cook rice, it means it took her 20 + 30 = 50 minutes to cook pork. Given that beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, it means beans took (30 + 50) / 2 = 40 minutes to cook. Therefore, it took Finley a total of 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes to cook all the food.\nAnswer: It took Finley 120 minutes to cook all the food.", "text": "Explanation: The response matches with the ground truth as it correctly calculates the total cooking time as 120 minutes.\nAnswer: Yes"}

{"task_ground_truth": "Every hour, Jay makes 20 snowballs.\nAt the same time, each hour 2 * 60/15 = <<2*60/15=8>>8 snowballs melt.\nThis means that each hour, Jay ends up with 20 – 8 = <<20-8=12>>12 more snowballs.\nIt will take Jay 60 / 12 = <<60/12=5>>5 hours to create enough snowballs.\n#### 5", "generated_response": "Reasoning: If Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour, it means that he can build 20/60 = 1/3 of a snowball per minute. On the other hand, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, which means that 2/15 = 2/45 of a snowball melts per minute. To calculate how long it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to find the time it takes for him to build 60 - 20 = 40 snowballs.\nAnswer: It will take Jay 40 / (1/3 - 2/45) = 180 minutes (or 3 hours) before he has 60 snowballs.", "text": "Explanation: The response does not match with the ground truth because the calculation and reasoning are incorrect.\nAnswer: No"}
{"task_ground_truth": "In the hamster cages, there are 10 cages * 5 pieces of straw per hamster cage = <<10*5=50>>50 pieces of straw.\nBetween the rabbits and the hamsters, there are 50 pieces of straw for hamsters + 20 pieces of straw for rabbits = <<50+20=70>>70 pieces of straw.\nAs the remaining straw is for the rats, the rats have a total of 160 used pieces of straw – 70 pieces of straw for the hamsters and rabbits = 90 pieces of straws.\nSo in each cage, there are 90 pieces of straw / 3 cages = <<90/3=30>>30 pieces of straw.\nThis means that each cage has 30 pieces of straw / 6 pieces of straw per rat = <<30/6=5>>5 rats.\n#### 5", "generated_response": "Reasoning: Let's assume there are \"x\" rats in each cage. Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, there are a total of 3x rats. Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of straw distributed to the rats is 6 * 3x = 18x pieces. Since a total of 160 pieces of straw were distributed among all the small rodents, the hamsters and rabbits together would have received 160 - 18x pieces. The hamsters are given 5 pieces of straw each, so the number of hamsters is (160 - 18x) / 5.

Since Uncle Ben has four horses, he will need a total of 50 * 4 = 200 pounds of oats to feed his horses for five days.
