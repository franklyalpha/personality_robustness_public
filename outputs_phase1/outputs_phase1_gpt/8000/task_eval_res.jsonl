Since each episode is 20 minutes long and there are half as many episodes, there must be 10 episodes in total. To find the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show, we can multiply the length of each episode by the number of episodes, which is 20 minutes per episode multiplied by 10 episodes.\n\nAnswer: John will spend 200 minutes watching the show if he watches every episode.", "text": "Explanation: The response matches with the ground truth.\nAnswer: Yes"}
